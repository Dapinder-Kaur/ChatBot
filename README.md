Big Project:

- Build a chatbot

Step 1: basic command line interface

Step 2: the word printing one by one.

Bonus points: add colors, handle history (save the entire conversation and send  it to the model again)

Step 3: Build UI like gradio

Step 4: Include speech-to-text and text-to-speech  libraries in your model

Final thing, you need to know is that you need to pay the resources whose API’s you are going to be using.
